"""Legacy organization endpoint tests have been removed.

This module is intentionally left blank because the organization API tests now
live under ``organizations.tests.test_organization_api`` alongside the updated
DRF implementation. Keeping the file avoids import errors for existing test
paths while signalling that coverage moved to the organizations app.
